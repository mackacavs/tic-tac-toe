## TIC-TAC-TOE

A tic-tac-toe game using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've used immediately invoked function expressions to build the application and throughout developed my use of ES6 features such as let and const and class constructors.

#### WINS

- A slicker functionality than I've used before - gathering dom elements at the beginning of my js file, using the array method 'some' to figure out which player (if any) has won the game
- My first project that I made without using tutorials to help me build the project

#### CHALLENGES

- Lots of complex functions that hd to work together to allow the application to work successfully

#### HOW TO PLAY

- Use **git clone** above to download the game on your local machine
- There's no frameworks, nor do I use npm to build with the application - so go ahead and run the project with **live server** in vscode or run it in yur local browser
